**SwiftButler (Swift AST Abstractor & Editor) - Phase 1 Architectural Summary**

**Version:** 1.0 (Post-Enhancements & Refactoring)
**Date:** May 30, 2025 (Reflecting final documented state)
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete, Production-Ready for Analysis

**1. Introduction**

This document outlines the final architecture of SwiftButler Phase 1, a Swift library designed to parse Swift source code and generate structured, insightful overviews of its declarations. Originally specified in `001_spec_phase1.md`, SwiftButler Phase 1 has undergone several iterations of development, refactoring (`003_refactoring_summary.md`, `006_argumentparser_migration_2025.md`), and enhancement (`004_phase1_enhancements.md`, `005_phase1_final_wrapup.md`). The current architecture reflects these learnings and optimizations, particularly focusing on providing high-quality, LLM-consumable output via its `.interface` format, alongside JSON, YAML, and Markdown.

This document serves as a snapshot of the system's design principles, core components, data flow, and key decisions leading to its current state, providing a foundation for Phase 2 (editing capabilities).

**2. Core Architectural Philosophy & Goals**

The guiding principles for SwiftButler Phase 1's architecture are:

*   **Accuracy:** Leverage `swift-syntax` for precise AST representation.
*   **Clarity & Readability:** Generate overviews that are easily understood by both humans and Language Models (LLMs), with the `.interface` format being a prime example of LLM optimization.
*   **Modularity & Single Responsibility:** Decompose the system into focused components, each with a clear purpose (a major outcome of the `006` refactor).
*   **Immutability:** ASTs and derived overviews are treated as immutable states, promoting safer and more predictable operations.
*   **Testability:** Design components for ease of unit testing.
*   **Extensibility:** Lay a clean foundation for future enhancements and editing capabilities (Phase 2).
*   **Direct Processing Pipeline:** Eliminate unnecessary abstraction layers for a clear data flow from parsing to output generation (key decision in `006`).

**3. Key Components & Responsibilities**

The initial `SwiftButler` class wrapper was eliminated (`006_argumentparser_migration_2025.md`, Stage 7) in favor of a more direct processing pipeline. The core library components (within `Sources/SwiftButler/`) are now:

*   **`SyntaxTree` struct (`SyntaxTree.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Wraps `swift-syntax`'s `SourceFileSyntax`. Handles parsing Swift source code from a file URL or a string. It is the entry point for obtaining a usable AST.
    *   **Key Methods:** `init(url: URL) throws`, `init(string: String) throws`.
*   **`CodeOverview` class (`CodeOverview.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Performs analysis on a *single* `SyntaxTree`. Extracts declarations, imports, and structured documentation. Filters declarations by visibility. Generates output in JSON, YAML, Markdown, and the highly optimized `.interface` format.
    *   **Key Methods:** `init(tree: SyntaxTree, minVisibility: VisibilityLevel)`, `json()`, `yaml()`, `markdown()`, `interface()`.
    *   **Properties:** `declarations: [DeclarationOverview]`, `imports: [String]`.
*   **`ProjectOverview` struct (`ProjectOverview.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages the analysis of *multiple* Swift files or entire directories (recursively or non-recursively). It coordinates multiple `SyntaxTree` and `CodeOverview` instances to provide a consolidated project-level view.
    *   **Key Methods:** `init(fileURLs: [URL], minVisibility: VisibilityLevel) throws`, `generateOverview(format: OutputFormat) throws`.
    *   **Properties:** `filePaths: [String]`, `totalDeclarationCount: Int`, `allImports: [String]`.
*   **`DeclarationVisitor` class (`DeclarationVisitor.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** A `swift-syntax` `SyntaxVisitor` subclass responsible for traversing an AST and extracting detailed information about each declaration (name, type, signature, visibility, modifiers, attributes, documentation trivia, path).
*   **`ImportVisitor` class (`ImportVisitor.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** A `swift-syntax` `SyntaxVisitor` subclass specifically for extracting all `import` statements from an AST.
*   **Core Data Structures:**
    *   **`DeclarationOverview` struct (`DeclarationOverview.swift`):** Represents a single Swift declaration with all its metadata (path, type, name, full name, signature, visibility, modifiers, attributes, structured documentation, and nested members). This is the primary data model for analysis results.
    *   **`Documentation` struct (`Documentation.swift`):** Parses raw Swift doc comment strings (`///`, `/** */`) into a structured format (description, parameters, returns, throwsInfo). Enhanced significantly through development cycles.
    *   **`VisibilityLevel` enum (`VisibilityLevel.swift`):** Defines Swift access control levels (`private` to `open`, including `package`) with `Comparable` conformance and string-based raw values.
    *   **`OutputFormat` enum (`OutputFormat.swift`):** Defines the supported output types (`.json`, `.yaml`, `.markdown`, `.interface`). Conforms to `ExpressibleByArgument` retroactively in the demo target.
    *   **`SwiftButlerError` enum (`SwiftButlerError.swift`):** Custom error type conforming to `LocalizedError` for clear error reporting.

**Demo Application Components (within `Sources/SwiftButlerCLI/`):**

*   **`SwiftButlerCLI` struct (`SwiftButlerCLI.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** The main entry point for the CLI demo application. Uses `Swift ArgumentParser` (`AsyncParsableCommand`) to handle command-line arguments (paths, format, visibility, recursion, output file).
*   **`SwiftButlerAnalyzer` struct (`SwiftButlerAnalyzer.swift`):**
    *   **Responsibility:** Orchestrates the analysis process for the demo application based on parsed CLI arguments. It decides whether to use `CodeOverview` (for single files) or `ProjectOverview` (for multiple files/directories) and handles outputting results (to console or file).

**4. Data Flow (Typical Single File Analysis for `.interface` output):**

1.  **User/Orchestrator:** Provides a file URL (or string) and desired `OutputFormat` (e.g., `.interface`) and `VisibilityLevel`.
2.  **`SyntaxTree.init(url:)`:** Parses the Swift file using `SwiftParser.Parser.parse(source:)` into a `SourceFileSyntax` object, wrapped by `SyntaxTree`.
3.  **`CodeOverview.init(tree:minVisibility:)`:**
    *   Instantiates `DeclarationVisitor` and `ImportVisitor`.
    *   The visitors walk the `SyntaxTree.sourceFile`.
    *   `ImportVisitor` collects all import paths.
    *   `DeclarationVisitor` recursively builds a tree of `DeclarationOverview` objects, filtering by `minVisibility`, extracting all metadata, and using the `Documentation` struct to parse doc comments.
4.  **`CodeOverview.interface()`:** Iterates through the collected `imports` and `declarations` (and their nested members) and constructs the Swift interface string according to specific formatting rules (e.g., property access patterns, enum case grouping, modifier display, documentation rendering).
5.  **Output:** The generated string is returned.

*(A similar flow occurs for `ProjectOverview`, which manages multiple `SyntaxTree`/`CodeOverview` instances).*

**5. Key Design Patterns & Conventions:**

*   **Visitor Pattern:** Used by `DeclarationVisitor` and `ImportVisitor` for efficient and structured AST traversal.
*   **Immutability:** `SyntaxTree` and `DeclarationOverview` (and its components) are value types or effectively immutable, promoting predictable state.
*   **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Heavily applied during the `006` refactor, leading to focused components like `SyntaxTree`, `CodeOverview`, and `ProjectOverview`.
*   **Value Types by Default:** Structs are preferred for data representation (e.g., `DeclarationOverview`, `Documentation`, `SyntaxTree`).
*   **Error Handling:** Custom `SwiftButlerError` enum with `LocalizedError` conformance for robust error reporting.
*   **Modularity:** Clear separation between the SwiftButler library and the SwiftButlerCLI application. The library has no dependency on `ArgumentParser`.
*   **Retroactive Conformance:** Used in the demo target to make library enums (`OutputFormat`, `VisibilityLevel`) conform to `ExpressibleByArgument` without polluting the library.
*   **File Organization:** Each public type generally resides in its own file (`003_refactoring_summary.md`).
*   **Naming Conventions:** Swift API Design Guidelines followed (CamelCase, no snake_case in public API after refactoring).
*   **DocC Documentation:** Extensive use of DocC for all public APIs.

**6. External Dependencies:**

*   **Core Library (`SwiftButler`):**
    *   `swift-syntax` (Apple): For all AST parsing and manipulation.
    *   `Yams` (jpsim): For YAML serialization.
*   **Demo Application (`SwiftButlerCLI`):**
    *   `swift-argument-parser` (Apple): For CLI argument parsing.

**7. API Design:**

*   The initial global functions (`parse(from_url:)`, `generate_overview()`) were removed in favor of a more object-oriented approach (`006`).
*   Clients now directly instantiate `SyntaxTree`, then `CodeOverview` or `ProjectOverview`, and then call output generation methods on these instances.
*   The API is designed to be clear, direct, and chainable, reflecting the processing pipeline.
*   Error handling is explicit through `throws`.

**8. Evolution & Key Architectural Shifts:**

*   **From Monolithic to Modular:** The `main.swift` in the demo and the original `SwiftButler.swift` class were significantly refactored into smaller, single-responsibility components (`006`).
*   **Elimination of `SwiftButler` Class Wrapper:** The top-level `SwiftButler` class was removed as an unnecessary abstraction layer, promoting a direct `SyntaxTree` -> `CodeOverview`/`ProjectOverview` -> Output flow (`006`).
*   **Focus on `.interface` Format:** This format emerged as highly valuable for LLM consumption due to its conciseness and Swift-native structure. Significant enhancements were made to its quality, including property access patterns, automatic import inclusion, and better documentation rendering (`004`, `005`).
*   **Enhanced `Documentation` Struct:** Evolved to parse more complex doc comment structures, including `- Parameters:` blocks and `- Throws:` clauses (`003`, `004`).
*   **Sophisticated CLI Demo:** The demo application evolved from a simple example to a flexible command-line tool using `ArgumentParser`, capable of analyzing various path types and directories (`004`, `005`, `006`).
*   **Support for Modifiers and Attributes:** `DeclarationOverview` was enhanced to include Swift declaration modifiers and attributes (`005`).

**9. Build & Test Environment:**

*   Swift Package Manager is used for building and managing dependencies.
*   A comprehensive suite of unit tests (14+ as per `005_phase1_final_wrapup.md`) ensures core functionality and edge cases are covered.
*   The demo application (`SwiftButlerCLI`) serves as an integration test and a practical usage example.

**10. Current Status & Readiness for Phase 2:**

SwiftButler Phase 1 is complete, stable, and production-ready for its defined analysis tasks. It has exceeded its initial specifications, particularly in the quality and utility of the `.interface` output format and the robustness of the CLI tool.

The architecture, characterized by its modularity, clear data flow, and reliance on `swift-syntax`, provides a strong and well-understood foundation for implementing the AST modification capabilities planned for Phase 2. The refined data structures (`DeclarationOverview`, `Documentation`) and traversal mechanisms (`DeclarationVisitor`) are directly applicable to identifying and targeting nodes for editing.

**11. Conclusion:**

SwiftButler Phase 1 has successfully evolved into a sophisticated Swift code analysis and interface generation tool. The architectural decisions, driven by practical application and user feedback (especially regarding LLM consumption), have resulted in a clean, maintainable, and powerful library. It is well-prepared for the challenges of introducing code modification features in subsequent phases.
