import Foundation

/// Represents a comprehensive overview of a single Swift declaration.
///
/// This structure captures all relevant information about a Swift declaration including
/// its metadata, documentation, signature, and hierarchical relationships. It serves
/// as the fundamental building block for all SwiftButler analysis outputs.
///
/// ## Declaration Types
///
/// Supports all major Swift declaration types:
/// - Classes, structs, enums, protocols
/// - Functions, methods, initializers
/// - Properties (stored and computed)
/// - Type aliases, extensions
/// - Enum cases and associated values
///
/// ## Hierarchical Structure
///
/// Declarations can contain nested declarations through the ``members`` property,
/// allowing representation of complex Swift types with their contained elements.
///
/// ## Path-Based Navigation
///
/// Each declaration has a unique ``path`` that enables precise location within
/// the declaration hierarchy, useful for cross-references and navigation.
public struct DeclarationOverview: Codable {
	/// Unique path identifier for this declaration within the hierarchy.
	///
	/// The path uses dot notation to represent nesting levels (e.g., "1.2.1").
	/// This enables precise navigation and cross-referencing within documentation.
	public let path: String

	/// The Swift declaration type (e.g., "class", "func", "var", "enum").
	///
	/// This identifies what kind of Swift construct this declaration represents,
	/// used for formatting and categorization in output generation.
	public let type: String

	/// The simple name of the declaration.
	///
	/// For most declarations, this is the identifier used in the source code.
	/// For operators and special methods, this may include the operator symbols.
	public let name: String

	/// The fully qualified name including parent context, if applicable.
	///
	/// For nested declarations, this includes the parent names separated by dots
	/// (e.g., "MyClass.NestedStruct.someProperty"). For top-level declarations,
	/// this may be the same as ``name``.
	public let fullName: String?

	/// The complete declaration signature as it appears in source code.
	///
	/// This includes parameter lists, return types, generic constraints,
	/// and other signature elements, but excludes the implementation body.
	public let signature: String?

	/// The access control level as a string (e.g., "public", "private").
	///
	/// Represents the Swift visibility modifier that controls where
	/// this declaration can be accessed from.
	public let visibility: String

	/// Additional Swift modifiers applied to this declaration.
	///
	/// Examples include "static", "final", "override", "async", "throws".
	/// Returns `nil` if no modifiers are present.
	public let modifiers: [String]?

	/// Swift attributes applied to this declaration.
	///
	/// Examples include "@objc", "@available", "@propertyWrapper".
	/// Returns `nil` if no attributes are present.
	public let attributes: [String]?

	/// Structured documentation extracted from Swift documentation comments.
	///
	/// Contains parsed information including description, parameters,
	/// return values, and throws information. Returns `nil` if no
	/// documentation is present.
	public let documentation: Documentation?

	/// Nested declarations contained within this declaration.
	///
	/// For container types (classes, structs, enums, protocols), this contains
	/// their member declarations. Returns `nil` for simple declarations
	/// that cannot contain members.
	public let members: [DeclarationOverview]?

	/// Creates a declaration overview with comprehensive metadata.
	///
	/// - Parameters:
	///   - path: Unique hierarchical path identifier.
	///   - type: Swift declaration type identifier.
	///   - name: Simple declaration name.
	///   - fullName: Fully qualified name with context.
	///   - signature: Complete declaration signature.
	///   - visibility: Access control level string.
	///   - modifiers: Array of Swift modifiers.
	///   - attributes: Array of Swift attributes.
	///   - documentation: Parsed documentation structure.
	///   - members: Nested declaration array.
